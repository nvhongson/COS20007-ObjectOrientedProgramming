COS20007 – Object Oriented Programming (Swinburne University)

High Distinction (80) 

This repository contains my work for COS20007 – Object Oriented Programming at Swinburne University. The unit emphasized core OOP principles including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction using Java.

Most of the code was written independently as part of my personal development and portfolio. The project demonstrates strong understanding of class structures, design patterns, exception handling, and file I/O.
